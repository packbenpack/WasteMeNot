# WasteMeNot
Like many people around the world, during the lockdown phase of COVID-19, I decided to push myself and start cooking more. I wanted to try all sorts of new recipes and ingredients from different cultures and climates. However, most new chefs can attest to the fact that our eyes can be bigger than our stomachs, and we might buy what looks good, and not always what we're certain we can cook with.

WasteMeNot is an app designed to fight food waste. Simply add any and all ingredients that are in your fridge that you either don't know what to do with or are going bad, and WasteMeNot will supply you with a smart list of recipes to make. You can filter multiple ways, including using more of your ingredients, or using less of ingredients you don't have. You can also save recipes to a "to be cooked" list, or save recipes that you cooked and favorite your...... favorites.

This app was created in 48 hours using Mongo, Express.js, React, and Node.js.

Simply download the files and run ```npm install``` and you're off to the races!
